            Hello! My name is Robert Stewart and I am a student at Bellevue University. 
            I am originally from Detroit, Michigan, but moved to Council Bluffs, Iowa about 13 years.
            I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in software development. 
            I am passionate about technology and enjoy learning everything about it.
        </p>
        <!--Paragraph 2-->
        <p>
            I am married with three kids who are ages seven, nine, thirteen. 
            <span class="sentence">My family is the most important thing in my life and takes priority over everything else. </span> 
            We enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and playing outside. We especially love to swim, but we don't have a pool.
        </p>
         <!--Paragraph 3-->
        <p>
            When I was 15, I moved from Detroit, MI to a town in New Jersey named Denville. I started my sophmore year of high school at 
            Morris Knolls High School. During my time there, I was a member of the hockey team, where we went to the state finals. After high school, I stopped
            playing hockey and started working at a yarn factory. I went to NYC four times a week to pick up materials and deliver them to the factory.
        </p>
         <!--Paragraph 4-->
        <p>
           Although I love all technology, I am most passionate about software development. Even more specifically, my focus is on web development. There is something about
           it that I find fascinating. I am excited to learn everything I can in software development and hopefully find a good job after I graduate.
